# ROCm Build Infrastructure Project

## Overview

This workspace is for build infrastructure work on ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) via the TheRock repository and related projects.

Project repository: https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock

## Working Environment

**Important:** See `directory-map.md` for all directory locations.

This is a meta-workspace. Actual source and build directories are scattered
across the filesystem and referenced by absolute paths.

Private/NPI repositories and source trees may be present beside the public
workspaces. It is OK to use those local files as task context when needed, but
do not leak NPI-only source, identifiers, private workspace paths or aliases,
internal branch names, non-public links or logs, or implementation details into
user-facing output, review files, commits, PRs, or other artifacts that may be
shared. Workspace-local inventory files may record local aliases or paths for
navigation. Public repository paths/worktrees are not NPI by themselves and may
be recorded when useful; prefer repository-relative paths in shareable artifacts
for portability. Summarize privately-derived findings at a sanitized level and
cite public equivalents when possible.

**Important:** Use relative paths when editing files.

For example:

- This meta-workspace directory: `D:/projects/claude-rocm-workspace`
- TheRock directory: `D:/projects/TheRock`
- Relative path to edit a file in TheRock: `../TheRock/docs/development/README.md`

## Project Context

### What is ROCm?

ROCm is AMD's open-source platform for GPU computing. It includes:

- HIP (Heterogeneous-Interface for Portability) - CUDA alternative
- ROCm runtime and drivers
- Math libraries (rocBLAS, rocFFT, etc.)
- Developer tools and compilers

### Build Infrastructure Focus

As a build infra team member, typical work involves:

- CMake build system configuration
- CI/CD pipeline maintenance
- Build dependency management
- Cross-platform build support
- Build performance optimization
- Package generation and distribution

## Common Tasks

### Building

- Builds typically happen in separate build trees (see directory-map.md)
- Out-of-tree builds are standard practice
- Multiple build configurations (Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo) often maintained simultaneously

How we build depends on what kind of task we are doing:

#### Developing Build Infra

Good for making changes to the build infra when we aren't expecting to need to do C++ debugging.

1. CMake configure:

```
cmake -B /develop/therock-build -S /develop/therock -GNinja -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx1201 \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
```

2. Build entire project (very time consuming)

```
cd /develop/therock-build && ninja
```

Configuring the project is often tricky. Rely on me to give you task specific instructions for configuration and incremental builds (or else you will initiate very long build time activities).

#### Working on specific components

Often we have to work on specific subsets of ROCm. We do this with -DTHEROCK_ENABLE_* flags as described in TheRock/README.md. Once the project is configured for the proper subset, it is typical to iterate by expunging and rebuilding a specific named project. Example:

```
cd /develop/therock-build
ninja clr+expunge && ninja clr+dist
```

### Source Navigation

- Source code is across multiple repositories and worktrees
- Git submodules are used extensively
- When editing build configs, check both source tree CMakeLists.txt and build tree caches

### Testing

- Unit tests, integration tests, and packaging tests
- Tests may run on different GPU architectures (gfx906, gfx908, gfx90a, etc.)

## Playbook

Recipes for common multi-step operations. Scratch directory: `D:/scratch/claude`
(large-file-friendly; switch if disk fills up).

### Download CI artifacts (without extracting)

```bash
# 1. Find the latest successful run for an artifact group
cd /d/projects/TheRock/build_tools && python find_latest_artifacts.py \
  --artifact-group gfx110X-all -v

# 2. Download archives to scratch (note the run-id from step 1)
cd /d/projects/TheRock/build_tools && python fetch_artifacts.py \
  --run-id=<RUN_ID> \
  --artifact-group=gfx110X-all \
  --output-dir=/d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<RUN_ID> \
  --no-extract
```

Common artifact groups: `gfx110X-all`, `gfx120X-all`, `gfx94X-all`

### Download a subset of CI artifacts and test locally

Useful for validating review feedback (e.g., "would this work if we moved
files around?") without rebuilding. Positional args to `fetch_artifacts.py`
are prefix-matched include filters.

```bash
# 1. Download only the artifacts you need (prefix-match filters)
#    Use --flatten to merge into a single install-prefix-like layout
cd /d/projects/TheRock/build_tools && python fetch_artifacts.py \
  --run-id=<RUN_ID> \
  --artifact-group=gfx110X-all \
  --output-dir=/d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<LABEL> \
  --flatten \
  "core-ocl_test" "core-ocl_run" "core-ocl_lib" "base_run" "base_lib"

# 2. Explore the layout
ls /d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<LABEL>/bin/
ls /d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<LABEL>/tests/

# 3. Rearrange files to test a hypothesis (e.g., "what if tests installed to bin/?")
cp /d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<LABEL>/tests/ocltst/* \
   /d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<LABEL>/bin/

# 4. Run from the rearranged layout
cd /d/scratch/claude/artifacts/<LABEL>/bin && ./ocltst.exe -m oclruntime.dll
```

Notes:
- `--flatten` strips the `<subproject>/stage/` prefix, merging all artifacts
  into a single tree that looks like a standard install prefix (`bin/`, `lib/`,
  `share/`, etc.)
- PR branch artifacts stay in S3 after GH artifact expiry — use the run ID
  from `gh pr checks <URL>` or `gh api repos/.../actions/runs`
- Always test with the ROCm-built libraries, not system-installed ones.
  Comparing against system versions can be useful for diagnosing issues but
  isn't the target test configuration.
- Artifacts built at one driver version may not work on a machine with a
  different driver version — DLL/so resolution may succeed while runtime
  behavior (device enumeration, kernel launch) fails due to driver mismatch

### Inspect an artifact archive without extracting

```bash
# List contents (zstd-compressed)
python -c "
from _therock_utils.artifacts import _open_archive_for_read
from pathlib import Path
with _open_archive_for_read(Path('<archive.tar.zst>')) as tf:
    for m in tf:
        print(m.name)
"
```

## Conventions & Gotchas

### Coding Standards

**Follow the style guides in [TheRock/docs/development/style_guides/](../TheRock/docs/development/style_guides/):**

| Guide | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| [Python Style Guide](../TheRock/docs/development/style_guides/python_style_guide.md) | All Python code |
| [CMake Style Guide](../TheRock/docs/development/style_guides/cmake_style_guide.md) | CMake build configuration |
| [Bash Style Guide](../TheRock/docs/development/style_guides/bash_style_guide.md) | Shell scripts |
| [GitHub Actions Style Guide](../TheRock/docs/development/style_guides/github_actions_style_guide.md) | CI/CD workflows |

Key principles across all languages:

- **Fail-fast**: Never silently continue on errors - raise exceptions immediately
- **Explicit over implicit**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Validate output**: Check that operations actually succeeded
- **DRY/YAGNI/KISS**: Don't repeat yourself, you aren't gonna need it, keep it simple

### Bash Command Conventions

These conventions keep Bash tool calls consistent with the permission rules in `settings.local.json`, reducing unnecessary permission prompts.

- **Paths**: Use MSYS2-style paths: `/d/projects/...` (not `D:/projects/...`). Read/Edit/Glob paths from the system use `D:\projects\...` regardless; this only applies to Bash tool calls.
- **Testing**: Use `python -m pytest <path>` (not bare `pytest`, not `python test_file.py`, not `cd <dir> && python -m pytest`). Passing the test path as an argument matches the single `python -m pytest:*` permission rule regardless of which directory the tests are in.
- **Linting**: Use `pre-commit run` (not bare `pre-commit` or `python -m pre_commit`).
- **Prefer separate tool calls over `&&` chains**: Permission matching treats `cmd1 && cmd2` as a single command string, so chained commands may not match individual rules. Use separate Bash tool calls when possible.
- **Copy files into scratch before processing**: Files outside permissioned directories (e.g. `/mnt/c/...`, `~/.therock/`) trigger repeated permission prompts. Copy them into `/d/scratch/claude/` first, then work from there.

### Git Workflow

#### Branch Naming

Use the pattern: `users/<username>/<short-description>`

Examples:

- `users/scotttodd/add-simde-third-party`
- `users/scotttodd/fix-cmake-detection`

#### Creating a Branch and Committing

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
cd /develop/therock
git checkout -b users/scotttodd/<description>

# Stage changes
git add <files>

# Create commit with structured message and Claude Code footer
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<Short summary line>

<Detailed description of what changed and why>

Changes:
- Bullet point list of key changes
- Another change

Additional context or testing notes.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# Verify commit
git log -1 --stat
```

#### Commit Message Best Practices

- First line: Short summary (50-72 chars)
- Blank line after summary
- Detailed description explaining what and why
- Include "Changes:" section with bullet points for key modifications
- Add testing/verification notes
- Always include the Claude Code footer (emoji + link + Co-Authored-By)
- **DO NOT include issue references** (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Addresses issue #456")
  - Issue tagging happens in pull requests, not individual commits
  - Keeps commit messages focused on what changed, not tracking metadata
- **DO NOT include pull request references** (e.g. "#123")
  - PR tagging happens in pull requests, not individual commits
  - Referencing _commit hashes_ is fine though
- **The "Changes:" section should add context the diff alone doesn't convey**
  - Good: why something was excluded, notable trade-offs, intentional omissions
  - Bad: restating which files were touched or what was added where — that's the diff's job
  - If the summary line already captures the full intent, omit the Changes: section

#### GPG Signing

- **NEVER retry failed commits with `--no-gpg-sign`**
  - The user uses a hardware device (YubiKey, etc.) to sign commits
  - If signing times out, wait for the user to retry manually
  - Do not attempt to bypass GPG signing under any circumstances

#### Submodules

- Git submodules are used extensively
- When editing build configs, check both source tree and build tree caches

#### Running Git in Other Directories

- Use `git -C <path>` instead of `cd <path> && git ...`
- This matches existing Bash permission rules and avoids unnecessary permission prompts
- Example: `git -C /d/projects/TheRock log --oneline -10` (not `cd /d/projects/TheRock && git log --oneline -10`)

### Review Workflow

Code reviews happen at two levels: **comprehensive reviews** (full PR/branch analysis) and **inline reviews** (quick feedback during iteration).

#### Comprehensive Code Reviews

When you say "review this PR" or "review my branch", Claude performs a comprehensive code review using the system in `reviews/`.

**Triggers** - any of these invoke the review system:

```
Review this PR: https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/pull/2761
Review PR https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/pull/2761
Can you review https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/pull/2761
Review my current branch
Do a style review of my changes
```

**Skills:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/review-pr <URL> [types...]` | Review a GitHub PR |
| `/review-branch [types...]` | Review the current local branch |

**Review types** (optional - defaults to comprehensive):
- `style` - Code formatting, naming, conventions
- `tests` - Test coverage and quality
- `documentation` - Docs, comments, help text
- `architecture` - Design, patterns, structure
- `security` - Vulnerabilities, validation, secrets
- `performance` - Efficiency, scaling, resources

**Examples:**

```bash
# Comprehensive review (all aspects)
/review-pr https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/pull/2761

# Focused reviews
/review-pr https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/pull/2761 style
/review-branch tests security

# Natural language
Review this PR with focus on architecture: https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/pull/2761
Do a security review of my branch
```

**Output files:**
- PR reviews: `reviews/pr_{REPO}_{NUMBER}.md` (or `_style.md`, `_tests.md`, etc.)
- Branch reviews: `reviews/local_{COUNTER}_{branch-name}.md`

**Severity levels:**
- `❌ BLOCKING` - Must fix before human review
- `⚠️ IMPORTANT` - Should fix before human review
- `💡 SUGGESTION` - Nice to have
- `📋 FUTURE WORK` - Out of scope for this PR

**Documentation:** See `reviews/README.md` for full details.

#### Inline Reviews (Quick Iteration)

For quick feedback during development, add inline comments with `RVW:` or `RVWY:` markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `RVW:` | Discuss - Claude proposes fix, waits for confirmation |
| `RVWY:` | YOLO - Claude makes the fix without asking |

```python
# RVW: This logic seems backwards - let's discuss
# RVWY: Add error handling here
```

Then ask Claude to "process review comments" or "fix the RVW comments".

#### Documenting Experiments

When running local experiments (e.g., testing with downloaded CI artifacts),
always include full command + output in the review or notes — not just a
prose summary. Others need to see exactly what was run and what came back.

- Inline the full `$ command` and its output in markdown code blocks
- If logs are too large to inline, save them to a local file (e.g., in
  `/d/scratch/claude/`) so they can be uploaded to a gist for sharing
- Always test with the ROCm-built libraries, not system-installed ones;
  comparing against system versions can be useful for diagnosing issues
  but isn't the target test configuration

### Task Tracking

Track work items in `tasks/active/`.

**Quick reference:**
- Start a task: `/task task-name` or "I'm working on task-name"
- Create new task: Copy `tasks/example-task.md` template
- Complete a task: Move to `tasks/completed/`

## Notes

[Add your ongoing notes, discoveries, and context here as you work]
- Note that TheRock is a super-project. The builds under the submodules (like rocm-systems) are sub-projects. Since dependency management is handled by the super-project, you want to refer to those build rules. For example, in the case of ROCR-Runtime and clr, see the `core/CMakeLists.txt` file. This is documented in docs/development/build_system.md.
- Never do `git push` without explicit authorization.
- Do not amend commits without explicit authorization. Stage changes and ask for reviews before commiting.
- Don't be a sycophant and stroke my ego about how right I am when I make suggestions. Remember that I can be wrong too and feel free to engage in light debate if my reasoning seems unsound but accept when I make a decision.
- Don't claim that the result of work is "production" code or use shaky metrics to justify how things are progressing. Just say how things are without superlatives.
- Before committing to rocm-kpack, run pre-commit.
- When writing design docs, always include an "Alternatives Considered" section to list major, rejected options. Don't include nit-picky differences, just major architectural alternatives.
